#Operators

# Assignment Operator
name = "Pramod" # '=' it will store the value of variable literal to the identifier

# Unary Operator  -? single value or literal
age = +95 #'+' is optional in case of postive int
my_bank_bal = -100
print(age)
print(my_bank_bal)

# Not Operator ->  unary -> Only booleans
is_married = True
print(not is_married) # not will do reverse
# Not operator is also called negations

# Is operator -> Identity operator -> do you belong to same data type, it will check
a = 5
b = 5
c = False
print(a is b) # True
print(a is c) # False

my_list = [1, 2 , 3]
my_list2 = [1, 2 , 3]
print(my_list is my_list2) # False -> although the list is same but identity is different
